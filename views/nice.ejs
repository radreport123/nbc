      <p>1. The elements of a system are often the easiest parts to notice because many of them are visible, tangible things. In the context of a university system, these elements include buildings, students, professors, administrators, libraries, books, and computers. These physical components form important elements of the system.</p>
      
      <p>2. However, understanding a system goes beyond its elements. It involves recognizing the interconnections that exist within the system. In the university system, interconnections encompass standards for admission, requirements for degrees, examinations and grades, budgets and money flows, gossip, and most importantly, the communication of knowledge. These interconnections facilitate the functioning and purpose of the system.</p>
      
      <p>3. Learning about a system's elements is often easier compared to understanding its interconnections. Some interconnections are tangible, such as the physical flows within a system, like water in a tree's trunk or students progressing through a university. Many interconnections, however, are flows of information. These informational interconnections involve signals that go to decision points or action points within the system.</p>
